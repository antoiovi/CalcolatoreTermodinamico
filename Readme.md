# Thermodynamics Calculator

There are two functionalities :

	- Panle 1 : Plots the Moody diagram and claculate the friction factor;
	- Panel 2 : Calcluate chemical properties product of combustion as specified by UNI EN 13384-1

## Execute demo
	
	mvn compile

Linux

	   ./demo.sh

Windows

	  execdemo.bat

## Execute

Java version 1.8 (tested)

	mvn clean package


	java -jar calctermodin-2.jar 


## Panel Moody Diagram 

Plots the Diagram of Moody .
Insert diameter and relative pipe roughness

OR

insert directly friction factor and tha Moody Dyagram is calculated and plotted


## Panel Combustibile
Calcluate chemical properties product of combustion as specified by UNI EN 13384-1
